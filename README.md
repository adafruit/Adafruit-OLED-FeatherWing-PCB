### Description

A Feather board without ambition is a Feather board without FeatherWings! This is the **FeatherWing OLED**: it adds a 128x32 or 128x64 monochrome OLED plus 3 user buttons to any Feather main board. Using our [Feather Stacking Headers](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2830) or [Feather Female Headers](http://www.adafruit.com/products/2886) you can connect a FeatherWing on top of your Feather board and let the board take flight!

These displays are small, only about 1"-1.3" diagonal, but very readable due to the high contrast of an OLED display. This screen is made of 128x32 individual white OLED pixels and because the display makes its own light, no backlight is required. This reduces the power required to run the OLED and is why the display has such high contrast; we really like this miniature display for its crispness! We also toss on a reset button and three mini tactile buttons called A B and C so you can add a mini user interface to your feather.

The 128x64 display is an SH1107, which uses only I2C so you can easily connect it up with just two pins used (plus power and ground!).  There's an auto-reset circuit and a reset button on the top. We've even included a SparkFun qwiic-compatible STEMMA QT connector for the I2C bus so you can plug and play any of our STEMMA QT, qwiic or Grove I2C sensors and devices!

Tested working with **all Feather boards**. The OLED uses only the two I2C pins on the Feather, and you can pretty much stack it with any other FeatherWing, even ones that use I2C since that is a shared bus. To use, [Check out our tutorial !
